# genetic programing
this is an exploration into genetic programming

## quick start
first you need the `stb_image_write.h` from https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h (the specific version i used is [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_image_write.h) but the latest will probably work fine)

then you can run the build.ps1 command in powershell

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

(this is not currently available for linux however it is *very* easy to port)
